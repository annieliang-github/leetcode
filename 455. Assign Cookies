Each child i has a greed factor g[i], which is the minimum size of a cookie that the child will be content with; and each cookie j has a size s[j]. If s[j] >= g[i], we can assign the cookie j to the child i, and the child i will be content. Your goal is to maximize the number of your content children and output the maximum number.
class Solution {
    public int findContentChildren(int[] g, int[] s) {
        Arrays.sort(g);
        Arrays.sort(s);
        int i = 0, j = 0; //分别建孩子和cookie的pointer
        
        while (i < g.length && j < s.length) {
            if (g[i] <= s[j]) i++; //如果满足，继续向下
            s++; //如果孩子的greed factor大于cookie，向下继续查找cookie
        }
        return i; //遍历到第几个孩子即为几个孩子满足  
    }
}
