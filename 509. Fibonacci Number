The Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted F(n) form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. That is,

F(0) = 0,   F(1) = 1
F(N) = F(N - 1) + F(N - 2), for N > 1.

Given N, calculate F(N).



class Solution {
    public int fib(int N) {
        if (N <= 1) {
            return N;
        }
        return fib(N-1) + fib(N-2);
    }
}


class Solution {
    public int fib(int N) {
        if (N <= 1) {
            return N;
        }
        int p = 0, q = 0, r = 1;
        for (int i = 2; i <= N; i++) {
            p = q; 
            q = r;
            r = p + q;
        }
        return r;
    }
}
